We came across recent research on non-invasive type 1 diabetes management (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2018.09.003). After going through the paper to understand this dataset, we listed down some of the insights which can be extracted from the dataset either through visualization or summary statistics: What is the difference in the glucose levels just before eating and 2 hours after eating? Extracting insights and comparing trends between healthy and diabetic patients. Explore correlations between changes in glucose level in the blood and ECG signals. Analyze the possibilities of activity levels and food intake having an influence on glycemic events. This dataset having subsets of healthy people and patients with diabetes, at a broader level we are interested to compare and explore the impact of Type 1 diabetes with the reference group i.e, characteristics of various measurements between the groups. Explore the impact of calories, food balance or food quality on the glucose levels. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The data set used for this project is D1NAMO (https://zenodo.org/record/1421616#.X3G7wpMzadY), which has been approved by the scientific community to allow for the research and analysis of diabetes management. D1NAMO stands for Diabetes type 1 non-invasive activity monitoring. They acquired 20 healthy subjects and 9 patients with type-1 diabetes. The acquisition has been made in real-life conditions with the Zephyr BioHarness 3 wearable device. The dataset consists of ECG, breathing, and accelerometer signals, as well as glucose measurements and annotated food pictures. Even though the data consists of only 9 patients, it has considerable number of hours of recordings which can be helpful for analysis. 8414 measurements of glycemic levels have been made for people with Type 1 Diabetes for more than 1500 hours. For data acquisition, the protocol is almost identical for both diabetes patients and healthy people groups. They were asked to wear the BioHarness sensor during the 4 days when these measurements are taken and are also instructed to take pictures of their meals. The only difference between the study groups is, healthy people group protocol instructed six glucose measures per day, one before each meal of breakfast, lunch and dinner and one measurement after 2 hours of every meal. For diabetes patients, glucose levels have been obtained from Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device which samples glucose measurement every 5 minutes. For descriptions of sensor data logged by Zephyr BioHarness 3 device, please refer to https://www.zephyranywhere.com/media/download/bioharness-log-data-descriptions-07-apr-2016.pdf The clinical data such as age, gender, height and weight of the people considered in this study, is taken from the paper published (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2018.09.003) with this D1NAMO data set. Note that this data is not directly referenced to the corresponding people in the data set to preserve the anonymity. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Note: One person in the healthy people subset of this data set has diabetes type 1, he is included in the healthy people set because he followed protocol same as healthy people for data acquisition i.e. he has not worn a Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device like other patients, so for the purpose of meaningful analysis, we are excluding this person from summary statistics or data visualizations used in the analysis. After downloading the original data set from data source (https://zenodo.org/record/1421616#.X3G7wpMzadY), and then un-compressing the folder, we get a huge data of about ~ 64 GB in size, so we are only including the relevant data files used here after pre-processing as described below. Please refer to pre-process_script.R file in the github repo for data transformation code that generates data files used in this present analysis. Data transformation steps: In the original data set used for this analysis, data for each person considered in the study is given separately in different folders. We have started with aggregating the relevant data for the analysis here, for example we have put together glucose measurements of all the people in healthy group into a single .csv file adding a column indicating patient number for reference, similarly aggregated all the glucose measurements data of diabetes patients into a single .csv file As described later in the results chapter, we are interested in looking at changes in glucose levels correlation with changes in other measurements, for that purpose we have taken sensor data for diabetes patient number 9, and aggregated the results to have a record for each minute using the maximum value recorded by the sensor during that minute, so as to combine these results with glucose levels later in the analysis "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values The data set has missing values, because of the following cases during the data collection period: In some cases, people forgot to note down the measured glycemic values or they had problems with the BioHarness wearable device Some people did not include pictures of all meals "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Understanding the sample considered for this study 5.2 Trends in glucose levels 5.3 Does changes in glucose level correlate with changes in ECG signals? 5.4 Impact of calories and food balance on the glucose levels", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Understanding the sample considered for this study In this data set, clinical data such as age, gender, height and weight are not referenced with corresponding person’s other data in this data set. so here we are just looking at the overall characteristics of the people considered in this study, just to get an understanding of biases if any in selecting the sample for the data acquisition. 5.2 Trends in glucose levels To understand how the glucose measurement values vary before and after each meal, we can look at the boxplot of glucose levels grouped by different categories, in this data set there is a indicator for whether the measurement value is before or after the meal, for the healthy group data set. We can see that on an average glucose levels tend to be higher in the measurements which are taken 2 hours after each meal, compared to the corresponding values before eating. As we have glucose measurement every 5 minutes for the diabetes patients data set, let us now look into variation in glucose levels for each of the diabetes patient during the data collection period: Looking at these distributions of glucose levels for healthy group and diabetes patients, it is usual that glucose levels for people with diabetes tend to be higher than healthy group, due to the fact that in case of type 1 diabetes, pancreas produce little or no insulin and as a result glucose builds up in the bloodstream as there is scarcity of insulin to let glucose into the cells. We see that patient number 9 tend to have less glucose levels compared to others, so we can infer that patient 9 is more prone to have glucose levels that can trigger hypoglycemia (blood sugar levels drop) events causing danger, as 3.9 mmol/l is the commonly used lower threshold for normal glucose. 5.3 Does changes in glucose level correlate with changes in ECG signals? Now let us look at glucose level variation with time for patient 9 on a specific day and then compare with other sensor data available, in order to detect patterns or correlations. We see hypoglycemic events from the above figure i.e when glucose level is less than 3.9 mmol/l. To clearly understand correlations for changes in values, let us look at relative value plots of glucose levels and other measurements collectively. Looking at the overall plot, we see that changes in glucose level doesn’t correlate well with changes in other measurements here. Now let us at only glucose level and ECG signal data variation with time. We do see that, when hypoglycemia events occurred, there seems to be sudden fluctuations in the ECG signal. This needs to be explored further considering new data collection in the future, as present data set has less number of hypoglycemic events for the diabetes patients. 5.4 Impact of calories and food balance on the glucose levels Having food information for each patient as well as their physiological signals — especially glucose — could be used for diet advice.Advice can either be in regard to the global health condition or in regard to glucose levels for decreasing risks for type 1 diabetes patients. The graph shows that diabetic patients attitude toward food, food control by consuming balanced diet was inadequate compared to healthy people. Reasons behind it can be eating disorders and eating disorder symptoms in T1DM patients or due to lack of awareness about the importance of diet planning and limiting cholesterol intake. D1NAMO dataset has been annotated by a dietitian with description of the food, an estimation of the number of calories, and an indication about the Food Balance and Food Quality.Food Quality is related to the amount of food items that should be ideally sporadically consumed in a meal. This information is valuable in the context of calories estimation as it impacts glucose levels. We can observe that healthy people consuming high calorie food have moderate and normal glucose level. The moderated glucose level is also impacted by the Quality of food. They tend to have high quality of food intake. Whereas diabetic people have a comparatively high range of glucose level even though calorie intake is regulated. This can be due to low quality of food intake i.e unbalanced food. As in type1 diabetes the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Food intake causes sudden increase in glucose level and insulin injected takes time to show its effect. We can see the general trend of high glucose level. We see that patient number 9 tends to have less glucose levels compared to others. Poor quality of food can also be a factor for hypoglycemia. As dietician has annotated food images taking in account individual cases. Person 9 has all the meals in an unbalanced category with very less sugar intake.
