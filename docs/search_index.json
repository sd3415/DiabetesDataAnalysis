We came across recent research on non-invasive type 1 diabetes management (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2018.09.003). After going through the paper to understand this dataset, we listed down some of the insights which can be extracted from the dataset either through visualization or summary statistics: What is the difference in the glucose levels just before eating and 2 hours after eating? Extracting insights and comparing trends between healthy and diabetic patients. Explore correlations between changes in glucose level in the blood and ECG signals. Analyze the possibilities of activity levels and food intake having an influence on glycemic events. This dataset having subsets of healthy people and patients with diabetes, at a broader level we are interested to compare and explore the impact of Type 1 diabetes with the reference group i.e, characteristics of various measurements between the groups. Explore the impact of calories, food balance or food quality on the glucose levels. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The dataset used for this project is D1NAMO (https://zenodo.org/record/1421616#.X3G7wpMzadY), which has been approved by the scientific community to allow for the research and analysis of diabetes management. D1NAMO stands for Diabetes type 1 non-invasive activity monitoring. They acquired 20 healthy subjects and 9 patients with type-1 diabetes. The acquisition has been made in real-life conditions with the Zephyr BioHarness 3 wearable device. The dataset consists of ECG, breathing, and accelerometer signals, as well as glucose measurements and annotated food pictures. Even though the data consists of only 9 patients, it has considerable number of hours of recordings which can be helpful for analysis. 8414 measurements of glycemic levels have been made for people with Type 1 Diabetes for more than 1500 hours. For data acquisition, the protocol is almost identical for both diabetes patients and healthy people groups. They were asked to wear the BioHarness sensor during the 4 days when these measurements are taken and are also instructed to take pictures of their meals. The only difference between the study groups is, healthy people group protocol instructed six glucose measures per day, one before each meal of breakfast, lunch and dinner and one measurement after 2 hours of every meal. For diabetes patients, glucose levels have been obtained from Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device which samples glucose measurement every 5 minutes. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Note: One person in the healthy people subset of this data set has diabetes type 1, he is included in the healthy people set because he followed protocol same as healthy people for data acquisition i.e. he has not worn a Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device like other patients, so for the purpose of meaningful analysis, we are excluding this person from summary statistics or data visualizations used in the analysis. Data transformation steps: In the original data set used for this analysis, data for each person considered in the study is given separately in different folders. We have started with aggregating the relevant data for the analysis here, for example we have put together glucose measurements of all the people in healthy group into a single .csv file adding a column indicating patient number for reference, similarly aggregated all the glucose measurements data of diabetes patients into a single .csv file "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values The data set has missing values, because of the following cases during the data collection period: In some cases, people forgot to note down the measured glycemic values or they had problems with the BioHarness wearable device Some people did not include pictures of all meals "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution of glucose measurements", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution of glucose measurements To understand how the glucose measurement values vary before and after each meal, we can look at the boxplot of glucose levels grouped by different categories We can see that on an average glucose levels tend to be higher in the measurements which are taken 2 hours after each meal, compared to the corresponding values before eating.
