This repo contains exploaratory data analysis of a health care data set.

We came across recent research on non-invasive type 1 diabetes management. D1NAMO (https://zenodo.org/record/1421616#.X3G7wpMzadY) dataset has been approved by the scientific community to allow for the research and analysis of diabetes management.

They acquired 20 healthy subjects and 9 patients with type-1 diabetes. The acquisition has been made in real-life conditions with the Zephyr BioHarness 3 wearable device.
The dataset consists of ECG, breathing, and accelerometer signals, as well as glucose measurements and annotated food pictures. 8414 measurements of glycemic levels have been made for people with Type 1 Diabetes for more than 1500 hours (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2018.09.003)

This project is about extracting insights from this dataset either through visualization or summary statistics.
