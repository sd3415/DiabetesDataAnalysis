# Missing values

The data set has missing values, because of the following cases during the data collection period:

 - In some cases, people forgot to note down the measured glycemic values or they had problems with the BioHarness wearable device
 - Some people did not include pictures of all meals
 
 
```{r}
healthy_df <- read.csv('data/healthy_patients_glucose.csv', na.strings = "")
colSums(is.na(healthy_df))

dia_df <- read.csv('data/diabetes_patients_glucose.csv',na.strings = "")
colSums(is.na(dia_df))

sensor <- read.csv('data/diabetes_patient9_sensor_data.csv',na.strings = "")
colSums(is.na(sensor))
