## Distribution of glucose measurements

To understand how the glucose measurement values vary before and after each meal, we can look at the boxplot of glucose levels grouped by different categories

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

healthy_df <- read.csv('data/healthy_patients_glucose.csv', header = TRUE, na.strings = "")
# excluding patient number 12 data as he is a diabetes patient
healthy_df <- healthy_df %>% filter(patient != 12)
df <- healthy_df %>%
  mutate(type = case_when(
    type == 'BB' ~ 'Before Breakfast',
    type == 'AB' ~ 'After Breakfast',
    type == 'BL' ~ 'Before Lunch',
    type == 'AL' ~ 'After Lunch',
    type == 'BD' ~ 'Before Dinner',
    type == 'AD' ~ 'After Dinner'
  ))
df <- na.omit(df)
df$type <- factor(df$type, levels = c("Before Breakfast", "After Breakfast",
                                      "Before Lunch", "After Lunch",
                                      "Before Dinner", "After Dinner"))
df$glucose <- as.numeric(df$glucose)
ggplot(df, aes(x = type, y = glucose)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("measurement category") +
  ylab("glucose level [mmol/l]") +
  ggtitle("Glucose measurements for healthy group by categories") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_grey(13) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

We can see that on an average glucose levels tend to be higher in the measurements which are taken 2 hours after each meal, compared to the corresponding values before eating.
