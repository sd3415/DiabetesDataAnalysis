# Data sources

The dataset used for this project is D1NAMO (https://zenodo.org/record/1421616#.X3G7wpMzadY), which has been approved by the scientific community to allow for the research and analysis of diabetes management.

They acquired 20 healthy subjects and 9 patients with type-1 diabetes. The acquisition has been made in real-life conditions with the Zephyr BioHarness 3 wearable device. The dataset consists of ECG, breathing, and accelerometer signals, as well as glucose measurements and annotated food pictures.

8414 measurements of glycemic levels have been made for people with Type 1 Diabetes for more than 1500 hours.

For data acquisition, the protocol is almost identical for both diabetes patients and healthy people groups. They were asked to wear the BioHarness sensor during the 4 days when these measurements are taken and are also instructed to take pictures of their meals. The only difference between the study groups is, diabetes patients protocol instructed six glucose measures per day, one before each meal of breakfast, lunch and dinner and one measurement after 2 hours of every meal. For healthy group, glucose levels have been obtained from Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device which samples glucose measurement every 5 minutes.
