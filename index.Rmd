# Introduction

We are interested in exploratory data analysis of a health care data set.

We came across recent research on non-invasive type 1 diabetes management (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2018.09.003). After going through the paper to understand this dataset, we listed down some of the insights which can be extracted from the dataset either through visualization or summary statistics:

*	What is the difference in the glucose levels just before eating and 2 hours after eating? Extracting insights and comparing trends between healthy and diabetic patients.
*	Explore correlations between changes in glucose level in the blood and ECG signals.
*	Analyze the possibilities of activity levels and food intake having an influence on glycemic events.
*	This dataset having subsets of healthy people and patients with diabetes, at a broader level we are interested to compare and explore the impact of Type 1 diabetes with the reference group i.e, characteristics of various measurements between the groups.
*	Explore the impact of calories, food balance or food quality on the glucose levels.
